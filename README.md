# AHSScoreServer
A java servlet based scoreboard parsing and filtering application. For deployment, I recommend using Eclipse for Java EE Developers and the Azure Web Application add-on to Eclipse for seamless transfer to a server. See the `processScores` class to edit the scoreboard URL, state, and division to filter.
