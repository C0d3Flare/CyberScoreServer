# CyberScoreServer
A java servlet based scoreboard parsing and filtering application. For deployment, I recommend using Eclipse for Java EE Developers and the Azure Web Application add-on to Eclipse for seamless transfer to a server.

After installation on server, go to /board-admin to setup configuration.
