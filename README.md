# CyberScoreServer
A java servlet based scoreboard parsing and filtering application. For deployment, I recommend using Eclipse for Java EE Developers and the Azure Web Application add-on to Eclipse for seamless transfer to a free Azure for Students web server. Of course, uploading this straight to your Tomcat server also works.

After installation on server, go to /board-admin to setup configuration. IF this is not done, errors when loading pages will occur.
